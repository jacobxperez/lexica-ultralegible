Designed for low-vision readers, certain letters and numbers can be hard to distinguish.
Lexica Ultralegible differentiates common misinterpreted letters and numbers using various
design techniques: B vs. 8, 1 vs. L vs. l vs. I. Recognizable Footprints:  Character boundaries
are clearly defined, ensuring understanding across the visual-ability spectrum.

> `Q vs G, E vs F, p vs q, i vs r, O vs 0`

Differentiated letterform’s: Similar letter pairs are differentiated from each other to dramatically
increase legibility. Unambiguous Characters: designed to increase legibility and distinction.

Exaggerated forms: Shaping of letters is exaggerated to provide better clarity.
Opened Counterspace: Open areas of certain letters are expanded to provide greater distinction.

> `aGbgrpqu Åö8ij%?¡:`

Circular Details: Links to the history of Braille Institute and braille dots.

## OpenType Features

OpenType features refer to different glyphs or character styles contained within an OpenType font. These include things like ligatures, kerning, fractions, numeral styles, and several others.

### Flip the Zero

By default the zero remains with a backslash `\` this was done to prevent confusion with the Danish Ø however, when pairing the typeface with a monospace that only supports a forwardslash `/` zero, this may create a cognitive dissonance problem. On that occasion, you might want to flip the zero:

```css
body {
  font-family: "Lexica Ultralegible", "Atkinson Hyperlegible", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 100%;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-variant-numeric: slashed-zero;
}
```

### Ligatures

Web browsers have ligatures activated by default, we recommend disabling them for heading or large display text.

```css
h1, h2, h3 {
  font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures;
}
```
